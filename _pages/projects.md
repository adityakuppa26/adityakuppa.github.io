 <h2>Neural Style Transfer</h2>
 </a>
 Style transfer takes two images (a style image and a content image) as inputs and creates a new image which captures 
 the texture and the color of the style image and the edges and finer details of the content image. This is performed 
 using deep convolutional networks.

 </a>
 Name Generator learns from a dataset of human names using character-level language model and then generates novel names
 on its own. This is implemented using recurrent neural networks.
