 <h3>Neural Style Transfer</h3>
 </a>
 <p align="center">
 Style transfer takes two images (a style image and a content image) as inputs and creates a new image which captures 
 the texture and the color of the style image and the edges and finer details of the content image. This is performed 
 using deep convolutional networks.
